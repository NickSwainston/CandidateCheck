Overview
###################

CandidateCheck is a repository storing python programs and (possibly) bash scripts aimed at assisting in finding possible new Pulsar candidates with the
Murchison Widefield Array PFD data files. 
The repository borrows code from scienceguyrob/PulsarFeatureLab (https://github.com/scienceguyrob/PulsarFeatureLab) to extract the relevent information.
Subsequent code developed should be designed with the intention of representing the relevent data from the PFD files such that it narrows or quickens the search
for new candidates.
