#Extracting:
- Use feature extractor to extract main data points from the PFD's

#Storing and Organising:
- Write said data points to CSV files line by line
- Store CSV files in files labelled by the position?? (or cand indentifier)

#Processing and Data Visualisation:
- Create period vs DM plots to help identify possible good candidates on a matplotlib scatter plots

#(more ideas)
- Average position for clusters on the scatter plot for possible telescope direction

Update 1
21st July 2021
########

It would appear that the PFDFeatureExtractor.py code has the wrong syntax for Python3
For example, containting print "...string...." rather than Print("....string....."),
Such syntax errors will have to be corrected before the code can be used properly in the Python3 environment

Shouldnt take long though, considering most syntax errors are quickly picked up in the editor.

########
Update 2
########

Majority of syntac errors were print command errors as seen in the previous update.
However there is one part of the PFDFeatureExtractor.py code that was slightly different.

 "isintorlong = lambda x: type(x) == type(0) or type(x) == type(0L)", Line 46

 The L in type(0L) was throwing an error. Pylance stated that it was expecting a closed parentheses ")" after the zero.
 After a cursory glance on the internet I found that 0L was likely referring to a type of long integer where
 the integer contains only zeros?
 In any case. The long integer type has been dropped since Python 3.0 and therefore I do not think the or command
 here holds any weight and I will comment it out to allow the code to run.
