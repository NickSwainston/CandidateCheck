#Extracting:
- Use feature extractor to extract main data points from the PFD's

#Storing and Organising:
- Write said data points to CSV files line by line
- Store CSV files in files labelled by the position?? (or cand indentifier)

#Processing and Data Visualisation:
- Create period vs DM plots to help identify possible good candidates on a matplotlib scatter plots

#(more ideas)
- Average position for clusters on the scatter plot for possible telescope direction
