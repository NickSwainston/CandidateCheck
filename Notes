#Extracting:
- Use feature extractor to extract main data points from the PFD's

#Storing and Organising:
- Write said data points to CSV files line by line
- Store CSV files in files labelled by the position?? (or cand indentifier)

#Processing and Data Visualisation:
- Create period vs DM plots to help identify possible good candidates on a matplotlib scatter plots

#(more ideas)
- Average position for clusters on the scatter plot for possible telescope direction

It would appear that the PFDFeatureExtractor.py code has the wrong syntax for Python3
For example, containting print "...string...." rather than Print("....string....."),
Such syntax errors will have to be corrected before the code can be used properly in the Python3 environment

Shouldnt take long though, considering most syntax errors are quickly picked up in the editor.
