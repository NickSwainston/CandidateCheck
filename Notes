#Extracting:
- Use feature extractor to extract main data points from the PFD's

#Storing and Organising:
- Write said data points to CSV files line by line
- Store CSV files in files labelled by the position?? (or cand indentifier)

#Processing and Data Visualisation:
- Create period vs DM plots to help identify possible good candidates on a matplotlib scatter plots

#(more ideas)
- Average position for clusters on the scatter plot for possible telescope direction

Update 1
21st July 2021
########

It would appear that the PFDFeatureExtractor.py code has the wrong syntax for Python3
For example, containting print "...string...." rather than Print("....string....."),
Such syntax errors will have to be corrected before the code can be used properly in the Python3 environment

Shouldnt take long though, considering most syntax errors are quickly picked up in the editor.

########
Update 2
########

Majority of syntax errors were print command errors as seen in the previous update.
However there is one part of the PFDFeatureExtractor.py code that was slightly different.

 "isintorlong = lambda x: type(x) == type(0) or type(x) == type(0L)", Line 46

 The L in type(0L) was throwing an error. Pylance stated that it was expecting a closed parentheses ")" after the zero.
 After a cursory glance on the internet I found that 0L was likely referring to a type of long integer where
 the integer contains only zeros?
 In any case, the long integer type has been dropped since Python 3.0 and therefore I do not think the or command
 here holds any weight and I will comment it out to allow the code to run.

########

It would seem the most important part of the code from the Pulsar Feature Lab is actuall a python code called PFDFile.py
This is responsible for actually reading information from the PFD files.

It might be possible to just take snippits from this code to read in the PFD files directly and hunt for the important parts with custom code.

########

Due to the many difficulties I am currently having just getting the orignal code to run without error.
I am downloading a temporary local file to work on my desktop computer with the intention of largely modufying the code so it works only with PFD files.

Using Git atm seems to be slowing me down and I am much more used to the Spyder IDE, which i will use.

If a working code is created that can do the bare minimum of readinf the PFD and writing relevent data to a csv file, I will upload
that code to a new branch.

Update 5

########

I have finally got the PulsarFeatureLab Source code to output data to a new CSV file I have created manually.
The only problem now is that the data being written to the CSV files seems to be a little buggy. DM is usually reported as 0.0 and the profiles being displayed, supposedly
over 100 bins, do not match that expected based on png files from the test candidates.

Despite this, I am still able to potentially write some code which uses the Source Code from PulsarFeatureLab to collate large amounts of data from many csv's.
I will persue this on a new branch, in the hopes that eventually the bug where DM is given as 0.0 and the profiles come out 'wonky' will be solves later on. 

########
Update 6

25/7/2021

########

The DM and profile bug mentioned above are both still issues but I have added functionality to the code with the hopes that the above problems will be solved
soon, perhaps after consultation with some of the nice people working at the ICRAR pulsar research group (I like to call them the 'Spinny Star People'). 

As for now, the code can accept user input for the location of the directory containing pfd files, can accept user designated output file path for csv or name and create
a local file for easy record keeping and general tidyness of the file system (its also more convenient).

The code as of yet does not allow the user to select what features they want to be extracted. I was unsure what ones would be particularly useful, but I was aware
that the data containing period, DM, FWHM and other reduced chi information would be useful. Especially considering that I am personally interested in seeing what results
from doing a scatter plot of DM vs Period for larger numbers of candidates. 

If im very good I wonder if it could be possible to plot the data in a 3D space. I could plot DM vs Period vs Position, with position on the Z axis.
Perhapse that could give some insight into how far away detections of candidates are being made from real positions or average positions. 
Maybe insight into the location of side lobes of the main beam?? Of course, I'm just thinking out loud (or on paper) but best write these things here before I forget.

More importantly here is a list of the current issues in order of most annoying;

1. plots of data keep showing up, which is annoying as it makes code execution take longer. I want to know how fast the code can extract the
   data from each of these pfd's so i know if it will be worth doing larger amounts of them or if i will have to change how im doing things.

2. One of the most important data points, the best DM, is given as Zero for two candidates that ive looked at, even though their data sheets say that they are clearly non-zero

3. The profile plots being output do not at all match what I was expecting. Im assuming the profile plot is supposed to look like the pulse profile plot that I see
    on the candidate data sheets, but it does not. Whilst I am not particularly interested in getting those plots just yet, it indicates to me that something is going wrong
    in the source code, likely linked to the issues I'm having with DM. 

4. The user input system does not account for lowercase letter selection
